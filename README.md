Flappy Bird (Java Edition)

Flap into fun – a smooth Java remake of the classic Flappy Bird game! 🚀🐦
Features

    🐦 Jump Physics: The bird is constantly pulled down by “gravity,” and hitting Space gives it an upward boost. The vertical speed is reset on jump, then a falling constant accelerates the bird downward

    .

    ⏸ Pause Functionality: Press Esc to pause or resume the game at any time (useful for a quick break)

    .

    🔄 Game Loop: A dedicated game loop thread updates positions, handles user input, and redraws the screen at regular intervals (keeping the gameplay smooth and responsive)

    .

    ✨ Smooth Rendering: Uses double-buffered drawing (rendering to an off-screen image before displaying) to eliminate flicker and ensure consistent animation

Demo


Screenshot of Flappy Bird in action (bird flying between pipes). The bird flaps through the green pipes in real time. Thanks to double-buffering, each frame is drawn off-screen and then flipped on-screen, eliminating flicker

. You can see the bird (our yellow character) mid-jump as it narrowly clears the pipes – that smooth motion comes from the game’s update-render loop working in harmony.
Build & Run

    Requirements: Install Java (JDK 8+). Use an IDE or editor of your choice (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.).

    Compile: From a terminal or your IDE’s build task, compile the .java files. For example, in VS Code’s integrated terminal you might run javac src/*.java
    stackoverflow.com
    .

    Run: Launch the main game class. You could use java -cp src MainClassName in a terminal, or set up a Java launch configuration in VS Code and press F5 to run

    . The game window should appear, and the bird will be ready to fly!

Controls

    Space: Make the bird flap/jump (gain altitude)
